// Consider the variable:

var groceryList = ["chips", "dip", "cookies"]
// Write the code that will add "soda" to the end of the original array.
groceryList.push("soda")
console.log(groceryList)
// Write the code that will add "granola" to the end of array without altering the original array.
var granola = ["granola"]
console.log(groceryList.concat(granola));
// Write the code that will return a subset of the array containing only "chips" and "dip".
console.log(groceryList.slice(0, 2));
// Write the code that will add "beans" to the "chips" and "dip" array.
groceryList.unshift("beans")
console.log(groceryList);
// Consider the variable:

var numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
// Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the array.
numbers.unshift(0)
console.log(numbers);
// Write the code that will add the number 12 to the end of the array.
numbers.push(12)
console.log(numbers);
// Write the code that will remove the first number from the array.
numbers.shift()
console.log(numbers);
// Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the array without altering the original array. HINT: it's not .unshift You'll have to get creative! ;)
var number0 = [0]
console.log(number0.concat(numbers)); // 0 + 2 , 4 , 6, 8
// Consider the variable:

// var numSet = [2, 13, 6, 8, 4, 2]
// Write the code that finds the index of the first appearance of the number 2.

// Write the code that finds the index of the last appearance of the number 2.

// Write the code that returns the number at the third index.

// Consider the variable:

// var characters = ["y", "a", "r", "r", "a"]
// Write the code that brings all the letters in the characters array together into a string.

// Write the code that reverses the order of the letters in the characters array and saves it into a variable called charsReversed.

// Write the code that brings all the letters in the charsReversed array together into a string with an asterisk between each letter.

// Write the code that brings all the letters in the charsReversed array together into a string without separators.

// Create two arrays consisting of three first names of your cohort members in each.

// Write the code that sorts the names in alphabetical order.

// Write the code that sorts the names in reverse alphabetical order.

// Write the code that sorts all the names in alphabetical order in a single array.

// Consider the variables:

// var numbers = [42, 221, 71, 7, 18, 87]
// var oddIndexes = []
// Write the code that logs the values from the numbers array that are at odd indexes.

// Write the code that adds the values from odd indexes into the oddIndexes array.
