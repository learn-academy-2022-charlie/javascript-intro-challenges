// Consider the variable:

var groceryList = ["chips", "dip", "cookies"]
// groceryList will only be declared once, we as a group understand that the variable is being modified as throughout the exercise

// Write the code that will add "soda" to the end of the original array.
groceryList.push("soda")
console.log(groceryList)

// Write the code that will add "granola" to the end of array without altering the original array.
var groceryListAdd = ["granola"]
var groceryListNew = groceryList.concat(groceryListAdd)
console.log(groceryListNew) // new combo array
console.log(groceryList) // original list unchanged


// Write the code that will return a subset of the array containing only "chips" and "dip".
console.log(groceryList.slice(0,2))

// Write the code that will add "beans" to the "chips" and "dip" array.
var groceryListTwo = groceryList.slice(0,2)
groceryListTwo.unshift("beans")

// Consider the variable:

var numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
// numbers will only be declared once, we as a group understand that the variable is being modified as throughout the exercise

// Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the array.

// Write the code that will add the number 12 to the end of the array.
numbers.push(12)

// Write the code that will remove the first number from the array.
