// Write the code that will log the outcome of 34 added to 71.
var numOne = 34;
var numTwo = 71;
console.log(numOne + numTwo)

// Write the code that will log the outcome of 67 subtracted from 123.
numOne = 123;
numTwo = 67;
console.log(numOne - numTwo)

// Write the code that will log the outcome of 56 multiplied by 23.
numOne = 56;
numTwo = 23;
console.log(numOne * numTwo)

// Write the code that will log the outcome of 45 divided by 5.
numOne = 45;
numTwo = 5;
console.log(numOne / numTwo)

// Write the code that will log the outcome of 5 to the power of 7.
numOne = 5;
numTwo = 7;
console.log(5 ** 7)

// Write the code that will log the whole number remainder of 33 divided by 6.
numOne = 33;
numTwo = 6;
console.log(numOne % numTwo)
// Write the code that will log the length of a string containing your name.
var myName = 'nic'
console.log(myName.length);
// Write the code that will log whether your string includes the letter "e"?
console.log(myName.includes('e'))
// Write the code that will log the character at the first index of the string.
console.log(myName[0])
// Write the code that will log the string in all uppercase letters.
console.log(myName.toUpperCase())

// Write the code that will log true or false for the following:

// Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?
console.log(34 / 3 > 67 / 2)
// Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?
console.log(5 == '5')
// Does 5 strictly equal "5"?
console.log(5 === '5')
// Does !3 strictly equal 3?
console.log(!3 === 3)
// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?
console.log('LEARN'.length === 5 && 'Student'.length === 7)
// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 OR "Student".length strictly equal 10?
console.log('LEARN'.length === 5 || 'Student'.length === 10)
// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "RN"?
console.log('LEARN'.includes('RN'))
// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "rn"?
console.log('LEARN'.includes('rn'))
// Does "LEARN"[0] strictly equal "l"?
console.log('LEARN'[0] === 'l')
// Modify the code from the previous question to return true.
console.log('LEARN'[0] === 'L')
// Consider the variables:

// var theQuestion = "life, the universe, and everything"
// var theAnswer = 42
// Write the code that will log theAnswer divided by 2.
// Write the code that will log the length of theQuestion.
// Write the code that will log the index of the character "f" in the theQuestion.
// Write the code that will log the concatenation of the two variables.
// Write the code that will log "the universe".
// Write the code that will log the character "l" from theQuestion.
// Write the code that will log whether theQuestion.length is greater than theAnswer.
